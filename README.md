# gmail_create_label

This is a simple application to create labels in gmail.

As I am currently looking for a new job, I have to send a lot of e-mails to different requirement services. My post box very quickly became a mess, and I decided to organise it in a better way using Gmail labels. I also found it inconvenient for me to set the labels within the browser version of Gmail. This application aims to make label creation a more simple way.
